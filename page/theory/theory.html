      stamped paper of Alipura State in India A 1934 stamped paper from Sangli
      State in India Stamped paper is an often-foolscap piece of paper which
      bears a pre-printed revenue stamp.[1][2] Stamped papers are not a form of
      postal stationery. The use of stamped paper in the American colonies was
      so unpopular that it has been credited with sowing the seeds of the
      American Revolution. Uses The stamped paper has been widely used around
      the world to collect taxes on documents requiring stampings, such as
      leases, agreements, receipts, court documents and many others. The papers
      are bought blank apart from the pre-printed stamp and are available from
      stationers, lawyers' offices, post offices and courts according to local
      regulations. The parties to the matter then write their legal business on
      the paper and lodge it with the court or other interested party. This is
      an efficient way of collecting taxes and stamping documents without the
      need to submit them to a separate government stamp office. History Stamped
      paper is thought to have been a Spanish invention,[3] being introduced (or
      reinvented) in the Netherlands in the 1620s.[4] It has been used widely in
      France (from 1651),[4] Great Britain (from 1694),[4] the United States,
      India and elsewhere. The 1765 Stamp Act required all British colonies in
      the New World to use stamped paper prepared in London and embossed with a
      revenue stamp.[5] This led to riots and political agitation which have
      been credited with sowing the seeds of the American Revolution.
