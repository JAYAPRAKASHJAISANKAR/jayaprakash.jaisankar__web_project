            An affidavit is a written statement of fact voluntarily made by the
            person under an oath or affirmation before a person authorized by
            law. An affidavit to be valid has to be executed on Stamp paper or
            duly stamped otherwise and has to be notarised by a Notary public or
            commissioner of oath. This affidavit is voluntarily executed in
            order to attest to the truthfulness of the foregoing narration of
            facts and undertaking under pain of administrative, criminal and
            civil liabilities, and for whatever legal purpose it may serve.
