      <h1>Farmers Welfare Schemes</h1>
      <h3>
        Government of India is according high priority for welfare of the
        farmers and is implementing several farmers’ welfare schemes to
        revitalize agriculture sector and to improve their economic conditions.
        The Government has rolled out a number of new initiatives like Soil
        Health Card Scheme, Neem Coated Urea, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana
        (PKVY), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), National
        Agriculture Market (e-NAM), Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and
        Interest Subvention Scheme. These schemes are for the benefit of all
        farmers. The details of the schemes are as below:
      </h3>

      <h2>(i) Soil Health Card Scheme:</h2>

      <p>
        Launched in 2015, the scheme has been introduced to assist State
        Governments to issue Soil Health Cards to all farmers in the country.
        The Soil Health Cards provide information to farmers on nutrient status
        of their soil alongwith recommendation on appropriate dosage of
        nutrients to be applied for improving soil health and its fertility.
      </p>

      <p>
        As on 11.7.2017, against target of 253 lakh soil samples, all 253 lakh
        soil samples have been collected and 245 lakh (97%) samples have been
        tested. Against target of 12 crore Soil Health Cards, so far 9 crore
        (76%) cards have been distributed to farmers.
      </p>

      <h2>(ii) Neem Coated Urea (NCU):</h2>

      <p>
        Scheme being promoted to regulate use of urea, enhance availability of
        nitrogen to the crop and reduce cost of fertilizer application. NCU
        slows down the release of fertilizer and makes it available to the crop
        in an effective manner. The entire quantity of domestically manufactured
        and imported urea is now neem coated. The reports from field are
        positive. The expected saving is 10% of urea consumption, thereby
        resulting in reduced cost of cultivation and improved soil health
        management.
      </p>

      <h2>(iii) Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY):</h2>

      <p>
        Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) is being implemented with a view
        to promote organic farming in the country. This will improve soil health
        and organic matter content and increase net income of the farmer so as
        to realise premium prices. Under this scheme, an area of 5 lakh acre is
        targeted to be covered though 10,000 clusters of 50 acre each, from the
        year 2015-16 to 2017-18.
      </p>
      <p></p>

      <p>
        So far 7208 clusters have been formed and remaining clusters would be
        formed during 2017-18.
      </p>

      <h2>(iv) Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) :</h2>

      <p>
        Launched on 1st July, 2015 with the motto of ‘Har Khet Ko Paani’, the
        Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) is being implemented to
        expand cultivated area with assured irrigation, reduce wastage of water
        and improve water use efficiency. PMKSY not only focuses on creating
        sources for assured irrigation, but also creating protective irrigation
        by harnessing rain water at micro level through ‘Jal Sanchay’ and ‘Jal
        Sinchan’. Micro irrigation is also incentivized through subsidy to
        ensure ‘Per drop-More crop’. The target under micro-irrigation for the
        year 2016-17 was 8 lakh ha. against which 8.39 lakh ha have been
        covered.
      </p>

      <h2>(v) National Agriculture Market (e-NAM):</h2>

      <p>
        The National Agriculture Market scheme (e-NAM) envisages initiation of
        e-marketing platform at national level and to support creation of
        infrastructure to enable e-marketing in 585 regulated markets across the
        country by March 2018. This innovative market process is revolutionizing
        agri markets by ensuring better price discovery, bringing in
        transparency and competition to enable farmers to get improved
        remuneration for their produce moving towards ‘One Nation One Market’. A
        target of integrating 400 markets to e-NAM had been set for March, 2017
        against which 455 markets in 13 States have been on boarded as on
        30.6.2017. As on 2.7.2017, 47.95 lakh farmers and 91,500 traders have
        registered on e-NAM portal.
      </p>

      <h2>
        (vi) Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)/ Restructured Weather
        Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS):
      </h2>

      <p>
        Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) & Restructured Weather Based
        Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) were launched from Kharif 2016 to provide
        comprehensive crop insurance coverage from pre-sowing to post harvest
        losses against non-preventable natural risks. These schemes are only
        risk mitigation tools available to farmers at extremely low premium
        rates payable by farmers at 2% for Kharif crops, 1.5% for Rabi Crop and
        5% for annual commercial/horticultural crops. The balance of actuarial
        premium is shared by the Central and State Governments on 50 : 50 basis.
        The schemes are voluntary for States and available in areas and crops
        that are notified by the State Governments. Further, the schemes are
        compulsory for loanee farmers and voluntary for non-loanee farmers.
      </p>

      <p>
        During Kharif 2016 season, a total of 23 States implemented both PMFBY
        (21) and RWBCS (12) and during Rabi 2016-17, 24 States and 3 Union
        Territories implemented PMFBY (25) and RWBCIS (9). Overall coverage of
        both the schemes is 401.52 lakh farmers and 385 lakh ha. area insured
        for a sum of Rs. 133106 crore in Kharif 2016 and 172.67 lakh farmers and
        195 lakh ha. area insured for a sum of Rs. 71696 crore during Rabi
        2016-17 season.
      </p>

      <h2>(vii) Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS):</h2>

      <p>
        The Government provides interest subvention of 3% on short-term crop
        loans up to Rs.3.00 lakh. Presently, loan is available to farmers at an
        interest rate of 7% per annum, which gets reduced to 4% on prompt
        repayment. Further, under Interest Subvention Scheme 2016-17, in order
        to provide relief to the farmers on occurrence of natural calamities,
        the interest subvention of 2% shall continue to be available to banks
        for the first year on the restructured amount. In order to discourage
        distress sale by farmers and to encourage them to store their produce in
        warehouses against negotiable warehouse receipts, the benefit of
        interest subvention will be available to small and marginal farmers
        having Kisan Credit Card for a further period of upto six months post
        harvest on the same rate as available to crop loan.
      </p>

      <p>
        Agriculture is a State subject and the State Governments are primarily
        responsible for the growth and development of agriculture sector in
        their respective States. The Government supplements the efforts of
        States through appropriate policy measures and budgetary support.
        Presently the approach of the Government of India has shifted from
        production centric to income centric platform in the agriculture sector
        and the above schemes are being implemented for making farming viable.

        Sabha today.
