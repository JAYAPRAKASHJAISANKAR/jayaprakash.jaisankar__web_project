        <h1>Tamilnadu Property Registration – Charges and Procedure</h1>
        <p>
          The registration or transfer of property in Tamilnadu is managed by
          the Registration Department as per the Tamilnadu Registrations Act. In
          this article, we look at the Tamilnadu property registration charges
          and procedures in detail.

          7% on the market value of the property and registration fee of 1% of
          the value of the property. In case of property registration on account
          of the exchange of property, stamp duty at 7% on the market value of

        <p>
          Prior to negotiating the price of a property and/or entering into a
          property sale agreement, the buyer must first undertake a thorough
          due-diligence of the property to be purchased. Since property laws and
          procedures are complex, it is best to engage a qualified Lawyer
          specializing in property transactions from the relevant area to ensure
          smooth completion of the process. (Know more about the procedure for

        <p>
          Once thorough due diligence of the property is complete, and the
          decision is made to go ahead with the purchase, stamp paper must be
          purchased based on the property registration charges. Stamp paper
          vendors must sell stamp paper at face value of the stamp. The Sub
          Registrars, Treasuries, and Assistant Superintendent of stamps,
          Chennai also provide stamp papers along with the stamp paper vendors.
          Further, stamp paper is also available at the “Stamp Sales Depot” at

          paper. The following personnel can prepare the sale deed: Advocates
          Licensed document writers Chartered Accountants having document
